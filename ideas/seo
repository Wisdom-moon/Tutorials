The implementation of OpenCL on CPU, accelerators which have no hardware scheduler, has a limit execution model.
The execution model of OpenCL is that all work items executed parallel, but one implement of OpenCL execute work items which within one work group executed serial.
The difference of execution model maybe can support specific optimization opportunity.
