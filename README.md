This Project is created by Peng Zhang on 2018.03.06.

This project is used to show the examples that how to program with LLVM API ,hStreams, OpenCL, COI, scif and so on.

I have try my best to write the tutorials simply, include the Makefiles. 
All the tutorials can be compiled easily with command 'make'.
